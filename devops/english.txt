First of all, I would like to say I feel so nervous because it is my first ever public speaking experience.
And I've been learning English only for a year and a half.
Yes, I enrolled in pre-intermediate classes in September 2017.
Why did I decide to tell you about my everyday work?
Because every time I meet new people I've been asked a widespread question. What do you do in your everyday life? What do you do exactly at your job?
And, because my job from the first sight seems so average and standard for nowadays, I've decided to compose a short story in the manner of an elevator pitch.
So, let's start.
I'm a software developer.
It may sound strange why I decided to talk about it, but I'm do coding from 1991.
And I've tried a lot of attractive even fascinating domains and had been taking a tremendous amount of positions from a conventional developer to executive C-level.
Why is that work interesting?
One statement. Not because of money.
